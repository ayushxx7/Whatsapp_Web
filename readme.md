Cool things done with python on Whatsapp Web!

1. Autodot

This is intended to test if a person is online or not, or to simply spam the s*it out of people/groups in your contact list. Completely dependent of current working environment and browser config including size of browser and location of web.whatsapp.com (tab number). It is advised to first check pixel location of name box(where name of contact is entered). 


2. Custom Messages

This was intended to add a real "human" feel to the otherwise forwarded Whatsapp Messages on Diwali (or any other occasion, but this was created a day before Diwali). Using PyAutoGui and simplicity of Whatsapp Web I was able to create a bot that would send pre selected (yet random) Happy Diwali Message and a Image from a group of images. The messages were of the format 'Blah Blah Happy Diwali cheap Forward blah blah '+contact_name+"blah blah", and it did wonders. People, for obvious reasons, thought I had put in effort (which I did by the way, but not like they imagined :P ) to send them a personal message. Replies poured in and I had hearty conversations with many individuals I had lost contact of.
